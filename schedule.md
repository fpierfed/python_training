# Advanced Python Course
## Three-Day Schedule

### Target Audience
This course is aimed at computer programmers who want to significantly improve 
their knowledge of the Python programming language. Course attendees should be 
able to write and debug programs in Python. More generally, they should be 
familiar with core language features like basic data types, control flow, 
classes, modules and functions.


### Course Format
This course consists of three full days of advanced Python classes in the form 
of live presentations and coding exercises. Attendees are encouraged to bring 
and work on their laptop computers. All course material will be made available 
under an open-source (GPL version 3 or later) license.
